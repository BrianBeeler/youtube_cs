This is a study of trends associated with popular YouTube videos in Great Britain. Top daily video designations are not necessarily based on number of views, but rather they are based on measures of user reactions to the videos. User reactions including number views, shares, likes, and comments.

The datasource is based on daily top trending YouTube videos that occurred in Great Britain on 205 different days ranging from 12/1/2017 to 5/31/2018. It includes 3,369 different titles.

We posed the question: “For top videos originating in Great Britain, how long do videos typically stay in ‘trending’ status?” To help answer this question, we created a histogram to categorize the trending times of the top videos. We hypothesized that the data would be skewed right: out expectation was that a large number of videos would be popular for a short period of time, and that a small number of videos would be in ‘trending’ status for a longer period of time.

We found that videos trend for between 1 and 40 days, with the mean being 11.5 days. The data appears to have an exponential decay from day 1 to day 40 in number of days in which a video trend. However, videos that trended for between 6 and 14 days did not follow this decay curve. Further analysis will be required to understand the reasons for this anomaly.
